                    <p>Centrifuges at the Fordo uranium enrichment plant in Iran are “no longer operational”
                    after the United States attacked the site with bunker-busting bombs, Rafael Grossi,
                    the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, said on French radio on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Inspectors from the watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have been unable to gain access to the nuclear sites since the strikes.
                    Mr. Grossi told Radio France Internationale in an interview that while evaluating the damage from the strikes using satellite images alone was difficult,
                    given the power of the bombs dropped on Fordo and the technical characteristics of the plant, “we already know that these centrifuges are no longer operational.”</p>
                    <p>The centrifuges — giant machines that spin at supersonic speeds to enrich uranium — require a high degree of precision
                    and are vulnerable to intense vibrations, he said. “There was no escaping significant physical damage,” Mr. Grossi said. “So we can come to a
                    fairly accurate technical conclusion.”</p>
